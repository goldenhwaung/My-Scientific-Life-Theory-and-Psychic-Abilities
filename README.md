# My-Scientific-Life-Theory-and-Psychic-Abilities
In this paper, I apply my Scientific Life Theory to examine whether various reported psychic abilities are scientifically and logically possible. 
Psychic abilities—such as telepathy, clairvoyance, and energy healing—are often claimed to operate beyond the limits of traditional physics. Therefore, if any of these abilities are real, they must involve not just matter and energy, but the life element or life spirit, as proposed in my theory.
I evaluate these abilities through both scientific reasoning and the lens of life theory, classifying which are consistent with physical laws and which contradict them.
